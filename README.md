# DemoProject
Here I have made two ec2 instance by taking ubuntu18.04 image .One I took it as master and other one I took it as worker node .In both i install ansible and docker and made connection in both through SSh connection.Then I wrote one plabook where I mention regarding all configration for WordPress.But this WordPress is
not working as  it reuire php and sql which I have not worked on it so it will take more time thats why I left this step.Then i created Dockerfile in which I have install python which is reqired for Docker communication.Then I push it to Github account.
